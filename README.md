My inspiration comes from impressionist paintings. First of all, I would love to create innovative creations based on this type of paintings. Here are some of the works I found.

I come up with 2 ideas.

The first was to combine the different elements of the classics of Monet's work. If I could, I also wanted to restore the color blocks of the painting as delicately as possible in the form of a sand spiel.

The second is to make the color particles move, and the figures and animals' heads move according to the mouse movement. 

Tecniquiesï¼š
Use JavaScript and CSS to dynamically adjust the color gradients of elements on a page to simulate color changes. By setting slowly changing transparency and color values, a flow of light and shadow is achieved. Use rust, webgl technology to make sand table. The perlin noise algorithm is used to generate random brushstroke textures, which are superimposed on the image in an animated manner. This makes the whole page look like a living painting. 
Here are some examples.
